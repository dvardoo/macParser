# macParser
A script written while working at an ISP where customer service often gave ous MAC addresses to search for in the network. 
The MAC addresses received where often i various formats, while the application for searching only accepted a certain format.

This lead to tiresome manual manipulation of strings instead of copy paste, wich was solved by this script on a calm workday.
